	Rename headings same with other datasets. Will have to do something like, add GK before each heading, etc.
	New function getLineupStats(), given a list of 22 players, hometeam, awayteam. 
	A list for each position.
	For line in file, if player name and team name match, then give indices and add to appropriate list (Some are DF/MF etc.)
	If pos is GK, then only get MP and Min. (Or maybe just ignore gk)
	Once all 22 player's stats have been added to the 4 lists, combine them and return.



spi_global:
	Get both teams spi rating and subtract them, no point we wont have historic data for this.
	dont bother.

Remember:
	Don't forget to cite where the data comes from, https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/3232/2019-2020-Premier-League-Stats
	Home team goals - away team goals. Will give +/- result.

	There's a match report on fbref for every match.
