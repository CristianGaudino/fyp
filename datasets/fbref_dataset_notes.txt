Fixtures csv:
	Main dataset, data will be added to here. This will become the dataframe for the model

-- Player Stats --
Will need to include individual stats for every player on the team.
Decide what stats I want for the 11 players
IDK what to do for this, can't get the starting 11.

spi_global:
	Get both teams spi rating and subtract them.

Remember:
	Don't forget to cite where the data comes from, https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/3232/2019-2020-Premier-League-Stats
	Home team goals - away team goals. Will give +/- result.
